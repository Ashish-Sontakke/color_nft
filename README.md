**COLOR NFT Dapp**

> The Project is built using the truffle framwork for solidity
> development and compilation.

You can create a ColorNFT by minting a hexadecimal color and put your nft for sale by setting a price for it. 

The project comes with very simple web front-end as well, as I am not very familliar with the front-end development it is very basic at the moment,
